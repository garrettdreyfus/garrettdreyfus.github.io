#+title: Mixed Layer Machine Learning
     
* What is the mixed layer and why do we care about it?
  The ocean's interior is so stratified by density that water formed in the North Atlantic is able to travel for hundreds of years through the deep ocean and for the most part maintain its same salinity and temperature. However at the very top of the ocean, changes in temperature, winds, and waves, are able to mix so well that quantities like temperature and salinity are nearly constant with depth. This layer of well-mixed water at the top of the ocean is known as the mixed layer. As the only part of the ocean directly in contact with the atmopshere, the mixed layer transfers heat and freshwater from the atmosphere into the ocean interior making it important to Physical Oceanographers. Phytoplankton that live in the mixed layer want a mixed layer shallow enough to see light and deep enough to pick up some nutrients making it important to Biological Oceanographers.
  
* How is it measured?
  There are two most commonly used mixed layer depth algorithms. The first is the De Boyer Montegut (2004) temperature or density threshold method which looks for depth at which the temperature has increased by __ C or __ kg/m^3 from the surface. The second is the Holte and Talley algorithm () that employs a decision tree to choose between the methods of De Boyer Montegut and a number of other metrics. Ultimately, the gold standard for determing the depth of the mixed layer from depth profiles of salinity, temperature and pressure is an oceanographer's visual identification. Both the algorithm's of De Boyer Montegut and Holte and Talley were developed to match the mixed layer depth as visually identified by the algorithm's creator.

* The survey!
  In reading about the mixed layer depth and the algorithms that are used to calculate it I became very interested in two things:
  1. How do well oceanographers themselves agree on the mixed layer depth? The spread of oceanographer's identification of the mixed layer would provide us with a lower bound on the error we can expect in calculating the mixed layer depth.
  2. Could a machine learning model provided with the mixed layer depth as identified by oceanographers better estimate the mixed layer depth than existing methods?
  To answer this question I created this survey. The survey displays 150 hydrographic profiles from all across the world (), and over different seasons. To date, I have collected ~1500 identifications. Feel free to respond if you are familiar with the mixed layer!
  
* How do oceanographer's do?
  Before we get into the machine learning let's first look at how good oceanographer's are at actually determing the mixed layer. The two panel figure below shows the distribution of the average difference between a respondants answer and the average answer for each profile. The distribution on the left shows that error as it is and tells us the average respondant
  The figure on the right shows the distribution of the error as a fraction of the mean at each profile. So, 1 on the x axis means that the average error from the mean is the same size as the mean itself.
